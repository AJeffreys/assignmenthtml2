	<h1 style="font-size:200%"><center>The basics of caring for a lot of animals</center></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 115%">The first thing that I really want to start off with is the size of our house. We have a two-bedroom, single bathroom home that was built before 1991 (my fiancé grew up in this house so that's how I know) so it is not a large space and as you saw on the last page, there are a lot of us here. We have decided to stay here until I graduate to give us time to save up and have our own home built but that means that we had to find a sustainable long-term way for the 11 living souls in this house to coexist in a happy, healthy, harmonious way. I think I can safely say that nobody wants to live in a home where you are constantly covered in animal hair, and it smells like cat box 24/7. So, I've made a list of the absolute most important things when living in a zoo.</p>
	  <h3 style="font-size:200%">The list of the really important stuff</h3>
			<ul>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Regular sweeping and vacuuming. This one is important for pet hair and dander. Dander can irritate allergies and I think we all hate having pet hair on our clothes. Another way that I prevent pet hair on my clothes when I live in a house of furry, cuddly, cuties is by designating indoor vs outdoor clothes. Indoor clothes are the clothes I wear to lounge around the house and cuddle animals and outdoor clothes are the clothes I leave the house in. I don’t put my outdoor clothes on until I’m about to walk out the door. </li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Cleaning up pet waste daily. Most cat websites suggest having one littler box per cat plus an extra one. That would mean seven litter boxes in our tiny, already cramped house. That wasn’t going to work for us. We have been able to comfortably live with just three litter boxes and the reason we have been able to do this is because we clean them out daily. I also add baking soda to each box that is mixed with pet friendly essential oils. We show our dogs the same courtesy as our cats by picking up after them regularly as well. These keeps our yard and our home smelling nice.</li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Toys and entertainment are another big one. Often boredom can lead to destruction. By providing toys for both the cats and the dogs we are stimulating their minds and providing them with exercise and entertainment</li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Respect for personalities. If you read the prior page, you may have noticed that each cat and dog have their own individual personalities. Georgie is grumpy and doesn’t like anyone but me to pet him. Antonio spooks easily and will run and hide if you are running near him. Leia likes to be cuddled. By identifying each other’s personalities, likes, dislikes, fears, etc... and respecting those qualities we can all live together peacefully without any creature big or small feeling like they don’t belong here. This works with other humans too.</li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Structured feeding schedules. There’s nothing like being hungry in a house full of other hungry creatures to get tensions high. To eliminate any food anxieties, we established structured feeding schedules for all of the animals in the house and we stick to these schedules regularly.</li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Personal space for the ones who need it. We talked about personalities earlier and this kind of and extension of that category. Some of our shyer animals enjoy having places they can call their own. For Little Bit it is in my fiancé’s computer area. Rick can be very possessive over food and prefers to have a crate that is only his that he eats and receives treats in.  By identifying these needs we have eliminated a lot of potential problems in our household.</li>
				<li style="font-size:115%">Love and attention. This is the last on the list but by far the most important. Everyone, animal or human, deserves love and attention in a way that makes them feel happy and safe.  </li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<p style="font-size:115%">I really hope that this page has been able to shed some light on what it is like living in a home with so many animals. There is a lot that goes into their care and our own care to make this situation work. I know this situation isn't ideal for everyone, seven animals are a lot, but I cannot imagine it any other way. Each animal in our home is an integrated part of our family. Most of them came to us in a time where they really needed someone to help them, and I am happy to have been able to do that.</p>
